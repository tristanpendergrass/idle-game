Harry Potter had Quidditch. Magic Idle would have...?

# Zephyrcourt
Just like quidditch takes after soccer/rugby, Zerphyrcourt takes after tennis.

## Flavor
Zephyrcourt would be a magical version of tennis where the mages use wind magic to fly and bat a ball back and forth between them. 

## Captaining a team vs solo play
I think it would be more fun and fitting for the player to captain a zephyrcourt team than to simply play to win as an individual. The other skills already do a good job exploring the power fantasy of growing in power individually pretty thoroughly. The power fantasy of Zephyrcourt will be to lead a team to greatness by growing talent of NPCs.

## Rules of Zephyrcourt
The rules don't have to be fleshed out at all but some sense of them should be conveyed by the game.
* A match is composed of 5 games, the team that wins more games wins the match.
* A game is between two players. The details below this level are left unexplained but presumably it's something like tennis where you're playing points
* The Captains of each side also play a game against each other like their other teammates but it has an outsized effect on the overall match. Perhaps 50% of the weight of the overall match rides on this game. The player therefore can win either by winning their personal match and going even otherwise or by leading the team to win most of their games even if they lose 

## Goals
You get returns from this skill through winning Zephyrcourt tournaments. To win tournaments you have to drill your team as well as train your own skill. As captain your game might easily decide the match. 

## Activities
Lead your team in practice, practice yourself.
