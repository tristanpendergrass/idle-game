Ok I already have the [[Combat]] and [[Combat (advanced)]] ideas written up, I will call this one "intermediate" for now, as I have more combat system ideas I may need a better naming system.

This one goes like this:
* Each monster has an HP. Early monsters have 1, later monsters perhaps as much as 10-20?
* You equip two spells in order to fight: the first dictates whether you "hit", and compares its to-hit value to the monster's power level and hits with some probability based on the difference. The other spell dictates how much damage will be done when you hit. 

I think this system avoids the extra complexity burden on the game designer and the player of the [[Combat (advanced)]] system while also adding considerable spots for content to be made:
* Monster can have armor which blocks flat damage done
* Spells can in turn give armor piercing
*
