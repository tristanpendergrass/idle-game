I like that the mastery xp pool exists and you can spend mastery from one item to fulfill the mastery of another.
* This means you don't feel like you're wasting your time if you level a level 99 skill, in fact it feels kind of good.
* New things you unlock can get a "leg up" because you can bypass the early levels by spending from the pool
* Adds an element of decision making. I feel smart for spending from the pool to unlock e.g. tier 50 bonus right off the bat.

The change I want to experiment with is this: add an additional requirement for leveling up the mastery of things. In addition to MXP it should require something else. I feel like the current system trivializes leveling additional things a little too much. What could "that other thing" be?
* Simplest is require a certain number of actions to be performed on that thing in addition to the MXP. 


# Boosting vs direct contribution
* In Melvor you spend MXP from the pool to directly increase your MXP in a certain skill. What if instead you spent MXP from the pool to give yourself boosted xp in a certain thing, up to a certain level? It amounts to essentially the same thing in terms of the math, but might feel better?
* This models how real world learning works: when you're good at a skill in general you pick up on new elements of it fairly quickly, but you don't magically already know them.
* Downside: losing the decision making aspect. You still have it a little because you might choose to level a certain single item for longer to get more MXP but you no longer decide to spend money from the pool. 
* How does this work with the 95-100% threshold though?
