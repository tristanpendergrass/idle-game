Mastery Unlocks are the bonuses granted for gaining mastery levels in an activity. For example:
* Every level gives +1% chance to double items
* Level 25: -10% interval
* Level 99: +5 gold per completion

Unlike with [[Mastery Checkpoints]] there's no perdetermined schema for the unlocks. Each skill can have:
* A bonus that scales *per X levels*, e.g. every level or for every 10 levels. Not all skills necessarily have this. A skill could have more than one, e.g. a bonus on every level and also every 10 levels.
* One or more checkpoints. Every skill will have a Level 99 checkpoint, most will have bonuses at earlier checkpoints as well.
