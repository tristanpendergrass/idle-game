Potions are made from simple ingredients and up to one can be equipped when doing any kind of skill. 

# Varieties
* Each skill has a potion associated with it. They must also be **unlocked by leveling up Potionmaking**. E.g. the Chores potion is available from Potionmaking 1, but potions for other skills must be unlocked through leveling up.
* Each skill also has a second potion that is **unlocked by some unique method**. This could be talking to a denizen in Adventuring, dropped by a monster, etc.

# Uses
Equip up to one potion in each skill, and enjoy its effects. You drink potions, roughly one per action, so more must be made.

For effects, see Melvor Idle.

# Mastery
In Melvor Idle leveling up mastery in potions causes you to produce higher grades of potion with better effects. 
Not sure if I like this because it causes you to have useless level 1, 2, 3 potions cluttering up your inventory. Should we think of another bonuse?
