Cost in terms of dev time: 1 (trivial commitment) - 5 (large commitment)
# Must haves

* (4) Can easily see what is actively training and link to it via status omnibar
* (2) Be able to browse freely without it ever canceling your impending action
* (1) Not have 69 and 420 references on every other stat block
* (4) Links to activities from item references
	* If a smelting recipe say it requires gold ore, you should be able to tap the icon for gold ore and be taken to the mining skill and have mining gold expanded and ready to begin
* (?) If you want to grind something you haven't done in awhile it shouldn't be that hard to start up in it again!
	* In Melvor if I haven't done e.g. combat in awhile it has a very strong negative aura around it because i know ill either have to spend a lot of time remembering all the different bonuses that are available and finding the right equipment to wear, or do it inefficiently. Probably both!

# Nice to haves
* (3) See skill xp bar floating at top of screen no matter where you scroll to in skill
	* Source: parv
* (5) solve the problem of feeling like you shouldn't work on a skill until you've done *all* the support thresholds you can
	* Fewer cross skill supports in general
	* Force progress in a skill at a certain level before upgrades can be utilized. e.g. if a skill can be practiced at level I, II, III, IV, and upgraded by purchasing upgrade from shop, don't let the player level it from level 1 to 99 using IV. instead the first part of the skill must be leveled using I, the next part II, etc.
	* Make the bonuses scale down in magnitude so you feel like if you got at least 2/3 of them you're really like 90% of the way there.
