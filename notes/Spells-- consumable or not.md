I've been changing my mind about which way spells should work. Currently leaning towards free.

## Consumable spells
When studying spells you are actually creating instances of them. Each time you cast it (for instance, for one combat) you consume the instance.
* Creates natural resource sink
* I like the idea of quests where someone needs your help and you give them spells you crafted, could be very flavorful. E.g. a heal spell given to an old lady who has arthritis.
* Makes earlier versions of spells not obsolete. Just like with potions, if you run out of the high tier ones you can fall back to the lower tier ones. What's the incentive to study low tier spells if the high tier ones are free to cast anyways?

## "Free" spells
When studying spells you are simply increasing your mastery over them. Spells are free to cast, ala Harry Potter.
* Makes spells feel different from potions. Otherwise they're both consumables that boost your abilities and thus would feel identical
* There's arguably more satisfaction in unlocking something when it's a permanent option than when it's temporary/consumable. See Link's breakable weapons in BotW vs earlier versions
* Lessens anxiety about idling because it's one less thing that might "run out" while you idle 
#### Won't free spells leave no incentive to master lower tier versions of a spell?
Possible answers:
* High tier spells are gated somehow, like requiring resources you don't have, or additional tuition to be paid
* Mastery 100 bonus for all spells regardless of tier that globally boosts that type of spell
* Some monsters can only be fought with low tier spells
* Simple completionism.
