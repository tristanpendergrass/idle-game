Nothing special spotted in [this Reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1epowcl/what_makes_an_idle_game_fun/) from /r/incremental_games, but as an exercise in following obvious advice, let's review it.
* Numbers go up (repeated in every answer)
* Numbers don't go up on their own, you have to influence it with smart decisions
* Numbers don't go up too fast.
* Discovery of new mechanics
* Clean, responsive, polished controls
* Let me customize the controls, move buttons around, scale up and down, etc.
* Number goes up. "more specifically, a big number, top of the screen, in your face, don't hide it in the corner"
* Bonus points if the game unfolds a cool "fantasy", like building up a town, an adventurer's guild, colonizing planets, whatever.
