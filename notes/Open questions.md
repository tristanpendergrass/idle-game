# Inventory
Should we do limited inventory slots like in [[Melvor Idle]]?
Should we do weight limited inventory? This would still lead to folks losing items due to it being full...
Should we do a stack size limit?
Should we do no limit at all? What would the money sink be then?

Should we have a lost and found system where you can reclaim an item lost through full inventory for a hefty premium?

## Best idea for now
The MI system seems ideal as a money sink. It is just the right amount of inconvenience. The only downside is that it makes what should be a fun moment-- receiving a rare new item you've never seen before-- an unfun one. My first thought is that now I gotta give up some other storage space to hold this thing, and I'm annoyed instead of delighted.
