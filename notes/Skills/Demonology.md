Players can choose to make a pact with a demon to enhance their abilties. The class teaching this is restricted and only allowed to be taken by upper-level students.

# Summoning
One of the features of demonology I like is the idea of the summoner not quite knowing what they'll get when they summon something. What if it worked like this?
* Activities are divided like so: summon lesser demon, summon greater demon, etc. Maybe we could get more creative than lesser -> greater, could instead do elemental or even something more original
* Performing the activity builds up points for that tier, when you reach a certain amount you can summon a demon of that tier
* In each 'tier' of demon there's a number of demons available-- they range from common to rare. You get a random one when you summon, and if you're lucky you'll get a rare one. If you're not lucky you'll get a common one
* You can equip one demon from each tier for global bonuses. So it is worth it to keep studying a certain demon type if you want to get the rarest version you can
* Demons within a given tier also are different in what bonus they give you, not just rarity, so you might want to swap what demon you have equipped for certain activities
# Benefits
Forming a pact with a demon will show a sign of that demon in the header at all times, clicking it will display a tooltip showing the benefits that pertain to the currently viewed skill.
