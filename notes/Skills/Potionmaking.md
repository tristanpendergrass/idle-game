Create potions to equip and enhance particular skills.

# Making Potions
The player can select one or more potions to brew in their cauldron. Each potion type takes up a certain number of slots and your cauldron's size determines how many slots are available. Player can upgrade the cauldron in the Shop for money and when at appropriate skill level in Potionmaking.

"Brewing"  takes a constant amount of time, so a bigger cauldron will equate to faster average crafting speed of potions. In terms of XP, MXP, bonuses, etc, completing a cycle of potionmaking triggers multiple activities, one per potion that was brewing.

There should be light decision making in terms of what is the most "efficient" combination of potions to put in the cauldron. For instance Potion A might take up two slots, and Potion B take up three slots, and your cauldron might have five slots. If Potion A is more needed by you right now you might craft 2 x A, but it would be more efficient to craft and A and a B and go for longer, building up a store of B for later.

# Potion infusion
One idea I'm exploring is making it so spells can be infused into a potion. Normally, a spellcaster has to be present to cast the spell, but with a potion they can give it to a non-spellcaster and that person can use it appropriately. Potionmaking would become the practice of creating potions that are pretty much the exact equivalent of other spells you know and which resolve with all the bonuses you have for that spell. 
* Could then give the potions away to people who need your help
* Could use them in battle to get a bit of a tempo lead by casting an extra spell by drinking the potion

# Varieties of potion
* There are two potions for each skill. The first is **unlocked by leveling up Potionmaking**. E.g. the Chores potion is available from Potionmaking 1, but potions for other skills must be unlocked through leveling up.
* Each skill also has a second potion that is **unlocked by some unique method**. This could be talking to a denizen in Adventuring, dropped by a monster, etc.

# Uses
Equip up to one potion in each skill, and enjoy its effects. You drink potions, roughly one per action, so more must be made.

For effects, see Melvor Idle.

# Mastery
In Melvor Idle leveling up mastery in potions causes you to produce higher grades of potion with better effects. 
Not sure if I like this because it causes you to have useless level 1, 2, 3 potions cluttering up your inventory. Should we think of another bonuse?

# Bonuses
* Increase size of cauldron should only come from upgrading size in shop
* However I like a bonus, maybe for Demonology, that lets you "overfill" your cauldron, but as a penalty get -50% Skill XP (or mastery xp?).
* Mastery bonuses should be relatively simple as they will get combined and all will be applied for each potion in the cauldron. 
* How about another bonus (maybe the two potions that apply to potionmaking itself are this) which apply a bonus stricly if either all potions in the cauldron are the same variety, or are all different variety
