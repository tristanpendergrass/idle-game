Exploration is a skill which offers rewards not found anywhere else. Although it's a left nav item, Exploration is not a Skill and doesn't have XP or traditional activity unlocks. Rather it has locations which you can explore.

# Locations
When you engage in adventuring you are always doing it in a specific location.
* School Grounds
* Small village
* Large city
* Evil fortress, outer
* Evil fortress, inner
## Unlocking locations
These will unlock in a scripted order based on completion of previous locations. To unlock a location:
* Have the appropriate power
* Unlock the previous 
Completion is a concept tracked by a completion meter going from 0 to 100% for each location. Complete them by doing all quests there and encountering all monsters and resources.

## School Grounds
### Resources
* Milkweed

# Quests
These are similar to the ones from Melvor Idle's Township skill. Pay up resources (phrase it as requires spells to complete in some cases).

# Monsters
Encounter these as you adventure. Unlike resources you won't immediately interact with them, but once encountered a monster type can be dueled in the Dueling Skill. 

# Resources
* What resources can be found in a location. The number of possiblities and some clue to their identity should be visible from the outset, but they must be "discovered" during exploration. 
* Discover resources as you explore
* Resources already discovered will still be collected at random intervals. Player may select which one is their focus. *Or should that require a spell?*
