# Professions

I think in the spirit of making V1 a simple Proof of Concept we should have 4 professions:
* Gathering
* Crafting
* Support
* Combat

These are the four archetypes of professions in my mind so having exactly one of each is like having a vertical slice of the game.

## Mining
Mine rocks to get raw materials. 

## Smithing
Smith metal from mining into bars, smith the bars into tools and weapons.

## Friendship
Visit with friendly creatures you encounter in the world to get bonuses from them.

## Combat
Equip your items from smithing and go fight to be rewarded with gold and unique items.
