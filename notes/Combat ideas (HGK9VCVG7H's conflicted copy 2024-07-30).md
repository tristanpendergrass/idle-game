* Mastery progression when fighting a specific monster:
	* Monsters have traits-- Ranged, armored, etc. You can unlock bonuses relating to these for items you have equipped or global passives, etc. 
	* Unlock weaknesses/traits of the monster by getting to know it better. Initially fighting it no bonuses-- hit it with any weapon, any armor type.
* Traits
	* Fiery - take 20% more damage from water spells

# Monsters vs threats
What if instead of each combat instance being a monster, they were a more general category of "threats". This would mean something like crossing a dangerous magical trap, or traversing difficult terrain, could be a threat the player has to plan for and overcome. We can have more diverse threats than monsters and also spells and equipment that let players handle them. Downside-- does it make sense to keep farming threats over and over for loot? Perhaps this would have to go with the model where you don't pick a monster to fight directly over and over but rather an area to explore where you encounter random different threats.

# Stat triangle
This is inspired by a large warning label on a utility shed I just saw. The pictorial label had 3 areas (represented by three quadrants of a diamond with the fourth being blank at the bottom) each with its own color and number in it. The three areas represented "hazard chance", "fire chance", and "explosiveness chance". This particular label showed a 3-0-0, meaning the shed had a high hazard chance and none of the other two dangers. This seems like a great place to start for designing a stat block for combat.

Suppose that each monster's combat can effectively be represented by a diamond with three numbers in it as the one described above. (what is the fourth area representing? Could be species, or maybe level?) The three areas could be 
* Magic 
* Physical 
* Knowledge
A monster like an incorporeal wisp might have a high magic stat, low physical, and medium knowledge. I'm not sure knowledge is right here-- i more envision knowledge as being something that's important against every threat.

### Fourth quadrant
An idea for the fourth quadrant is it is an icon + color that is specific to the "power" of this threat, the special effect. It could be e.g.
* Weakness to a certain element
* Weakness to a certain item
Something that affects gameplay. The master levels of the threat could change this.

## Overcoming threats
### Primary and secondary spells
Part of this stat triangle model is the idea that for combat the player can lock in one single spell to buff their stats, and one secondary. The same spell has different effects if locked as primary vs secondary. The primary will almost always help with overcoming the threat, the secondary is something else like buff to loot gained, buff to recovery time, resource preservation, etc.

## Balancing
I envision the balance working out sort of like this: if the player has stats for each of Magic (M), Physical (P), and Knowledge (K) that are EQUAL to the challenge of the threat, they should have a 50/50 chance of overcoming. For each stat, if the player has less it should decrease these odds, getting a greater marginal penalty the further they are.

Beginning combat, it should be the case it's possible to lock a spell that buffs the stat (magical or phyical) that you need against this threat, but the other stats will generally stay at 0. Finding sources to buff the player stats not being buffed by the primary spell should be difficult indeed-- and even one point here or there is celebrated. For instance it could be a payoff to mastery in a spell study, or a very valued buff on gear. I envision it being like:
Early monster has (M = 10, P = 3, K = 2). The player can lock in a spell that gives them M = 10, but the other stats are naturally at 0. So the player gets their chance adjusted downwards pretty badly because on M they meet the threat but on the other two they're 3 and 2 below. To resolve, they find some gear that gives them 1 or 2 P and K, and then they have a reasonable fighting chance.
