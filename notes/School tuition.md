Each class has three levels:
* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

Activites within the skill fall into one of the levels and each has to be qualified for (and sometimes paid for) in sequence. There may be interlocking requirements (e.g. completing intermediate botany to unlock intermediate potionmaking). 

I'm not sure this is actually a good idea. The simple act of doing a skill over and over to get XP to level it is not something I want to mess with and gate behind money.
