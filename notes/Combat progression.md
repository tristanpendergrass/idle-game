# Early game
* The early game of [[Melvor Idle]] has tons of options and I found myself overwhelmed by choices early on. I think at the start there should be only about three or maybe two monsters to choose between with distinct differences in things they drop.

# Boss monsters
These should feel more like raid bosses and require significant chunks of time to beat.
Bosses should gate the way to new combat areas instead of them all being unlocked from the start.
Respawn timers of bosses should be on the order of real-time days.
