# Storytelling
Storytelling is our stand in for the tasks system in [[Melvor Idle]]. Instead of grouped by "Easy" through "Elite", the tasks are chapters in a story.

Chapter 1 - Oil in the River
(tasks: rebuild the beaver dam - 10,000 wood)
...
Chapter 9 - Hell for Certain

# Buildings
Or intead buildings could be our tasks. Buildings require materials to make and yield either an ongoing bonus (like a pet) or else a one time bonus (like tasks).
