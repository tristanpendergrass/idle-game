* Theory of Magic
* wizard of earthsea

# Elements
* Underdog protagonist that's out of place at school
	* Harry potter & Ged both fit this as they're outsiders
	* Our hero will also be this way as you'll start out a stableboy 
* Low magic
	* I like earthsea's low magic environment more than harry potter's disneyland magic. In earthsea ged learns early on that it's wisest to withold your magic until the appropriate moment. Not sure how to reflect that in gameplay.
* Mischief
	* Harry potter made a virtue out of disrespecting authority and there's several characters and subplots revolving around mischief for its own sake. 
	* I think it's a good excure for global xp buffs. A chaotic environment is more conducive to learning than a strict ordered one as harry potter 5's lesson went.
* Exploration
	* I think it's underappreciated in HP but what people love the most about hogwarts is the sense you can go exploring...in the different rooms, in the grounds, the nearby wild woods, diagon alley, etc.
* Powers beyond your command
	* Also not sure how to work this into gameplay but an essential element of Earthsea & HP is that there are powers beyond your comprehension that you might bump into when studying magic.


# Wandmaking

What if wands required inputs from multiple skills?
