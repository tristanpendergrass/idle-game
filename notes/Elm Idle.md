# Principles
These are usually violated in a couple places, but should be respected for 90% of cases.
* No daily/weekly content. We want to respect folks' time. Adding daily or weekly recurring quests and rewards makes the game feel like a chore or a job. Having to login periodically to switch tasks should be more than enough. Can experiment with a little of this though like farming. But perhaps max 1 skill that involves it?
* Anything you can do, you can do it lots. Everything should be repeatable, even bosses/dungeons. There should be almost nothing where you login, do it, then switch to something else. Exceptions for making new gear, upgrading items, etc.
* No hard requirements about what order you do things. Besides crafting/support skills requiring stuff from other skills, you should be able to level up any skill you want in whatever order. The bonus for playing "optimally" shouldn't be more than about 2x speed, maybe even only 1.5x speed.
