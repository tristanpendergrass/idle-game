Works similar to Summoning from Melvor Idle.

# Discovering a familiar
The familiar will start out unknown in the UI, but become known after a random amount of actions in the associated skill. If your skill in Familiars is not high enough, disovery will lead you to "feel an unseen presence" but not be able to perceive or interact with the familiar. The UI in Familiars should reflect whether a familiar is not yet encountered, encountered but too high level for you, or discovered.

# Training
Each familiar has a mastery level (referred to as Bond or Experience in the UI?), and training with it directly in the Familiars tab gives you Familiars Skill XP as well as MXP in the corresponding Familiar. As you level up the thresholds it will empower the familiar to grant you better bonuses when helping you.

This action also costs a resource but gives you Feed for that familiar. 

# Using in skills
The primary purpose of familiars is to empower you in doing other skills. Once you have:
* discovered the familiar
* can perceieve the familiar
associated with a skill it will be enabled when taking actions in that skill.

You can also optionally enabled a second familiar from another skill to be granted their synergy bonus. Having another familiar help you in this way requires Feed for it (they get hungry when away from home). They synergy bonus does not depend on the mastery of either familiar.

# Differences
* Familiars might differ from each other by how much training they require. e.g. a Cat might not be able to be trained at all. Others might require long training but cheap food, etc.
