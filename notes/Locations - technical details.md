## Unlocking stuff

How should unlocking stuff work? The naive solution is something like: on each explore action (roughly every 5 seconds spent exploring) roll a 1-100. 5% chance to discover resource, 5% chance for monster, 10% chance to gather, etc.

I have a feeling we will want to exert a little more control over the process as game designer than that and not allow such crazy variance as exploring for 1 year and still never finding a certain resource.
