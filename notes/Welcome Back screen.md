[[Melvor Idle]]'s welcome back screen is pretty close to optimal. Most of the stuff I see on there seems useful and should be there.
Essential elements:
* Icon showing what you've been grinding
* Tell you how long you're gone for
* How much xp you got, and whether you leveled up
* *NEW* whether you leveled up mastery
* Resources you gained/spent
