Players have a roster of monsters to fight. When they choose to fight one the battle will proceed automatically. If the player wins they will get loot and experience, if they lose they will have to spend some time regenerating. In either case they will automatically fight the monster again afterwards and this will repeat indefinitely.

## Chance to win
The key statistic of a combat you've left to idle is your win percentage: it could be 0% or 100% or anything in between based on your gear, the monster level, or any other circumstances. As the player you want this to be as high as possible as the loot from the monster is only dropped in the case that you win.

## Monster mastery
Just as you gain mastery XP in activities, gain mxp per monster you fight. There will be thresholds of mastery points per monster and as you meet them it unlocks:
* Weakness of the monster
* Greater rewards for beating it
Perhaps we should consider some consistency on this point: one threshold for weakness, one for greater reward for beating it.

Monster mastery is gained when you defeat the monster. It is not gained when you lose to it; however you bank half of what you would have gained when you lose and the total banked mastery xp is gained after the next win.

## Regeneration
When the player loses a combat their character goes into a state of regeneration for a fixed amount of time. It happens automatically and when complete they automatically begin the same fight over again.

Items/spells can give bonuses related to regeneration:
- Boost regen speed
- Buff to next fight after a regen
- Gain mastery vs the thing that caused you to regen during regen

## First Conquest reward
The first time a monster is defeated you receive a First Conquest reward:
* Show a notification in the UI on the monster's tile. When clicked it says the monster was defeated and the player is granted a one time bonus. Could be extra of whatever they normally drop or a unique item.
* Checkmark of some kind on the monster to show you've beaten it.
The idea is that we can avoid what i felt in melvor was too much temptation to blow past all the different monsters that were available to train. Felt a little like i shouldn't bother to beat them and i would never remember if i even had.

# Combat Spells
## Types of spells
Spells in combat should generally fall into one of several categories:
* Damage spells. Ideal for pushing difficult content and required in most every loadout.
* Healing/defense spells. Also mainly necessary for difficult content.
* Support spells, buffs the others.
* Meta spells, interact with the larger combat cyle in some way by buffing drops, buffing regen time, etc.
## Cycle of usefulness
Ideally combat spells go through the following pattern over time:
* When first unlocked they are exciting to put in your rotation and allow you to improve your combat outcomes; either pushing higher level monsters or improving winrate/droprate of existing monsters.
* Eventually they are outclassed by subsequently unlocked spells and are only useful on content you've outleveled. It would be a waste to use your most powerful spells on old content and you still have to farm old content for various reasons so the spell is still useful for that.
* Eventually you've got enough spells that can slay old content that you don't need most of them. There should be ways of recycling or upcycling the spells for mats, with selling them for small amount of coin as a last resort.

## Tags and Mastery
Mastery in combat is not done on a per-monster basis but on a per-tag basis. Each monster would have one or more tags, e.g. Beast, Militia. When you fight monsters you get mastery xp in their tags and level up those tags. Tags have mastery thresholds just like skills do that expose weaknesses of the monsters that have that tag, or grant better rewards against that monster.

# Spell ideas
* Deal small damage. Deal more for each consecutive instance of this spell that is cast
* Support spell that increases loot from this combat. Or increases mxp gained if lose the combat.
* Support spell that gives a chance to recover other spells used in this combat

# Tag ideas
Monsters have tags that alter combat with them in some way.
* Feral - each consecutive move that does damage does even more damage (incentivize to let them hit you once or twice then interrupt with a strong block)
* Bounty - this monster i wanted by authorities. Not sure the effect ..

# Random concepts
* Mana system like in Yi Xian
* Take damage = get better stuff support spell. Useful for farming lower tier mobs later like in Returnal
* Helpers and lackeys.
    * One part meat shield, one part
