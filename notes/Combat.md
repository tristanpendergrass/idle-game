## Chance to win
The key statistic of a combat you've left to idle is your win percentage: it could be 0% or 100% or anything in between based on your gear, the monster level, or any other circumstances. As the player you want this to be as high as possible as the loot from the monster is only dropped in the case that you win. 

## Monster mastery
Just as you gain mastery XP in activities by doing them you should get mxp per monster you farm. There will be thresholds and as you meet them it unlocks:
* Weakness of the monster
* Greater rewards for beating it

Monster mastery is gained when you defeat the monster. It is not gained when you lose to it; however you bank half of what you would have gained when you lose and the total banked mastery xp is gained after the next win.

## Regeneration
Happens after you lose a fight. Should a long time relative to the average length of a combat. Reason being that we want the incentive to win combat to greatly exceed the incentive to make combat fast at the expense of some chance of loss. That's not a fun tradeoff to be forced to think about.

Stats related to regeneration:
- Boost regen speed
- Buff to next fight after a regen
- Gain mastery vs the thing that caused you to regen during regen
