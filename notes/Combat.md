Players have a roster of monsters to fight. When they choose to fight one the battle will proceed automatically. If the player wins they will get loot and experience, if they lose they will have to spend some time regenerating. In either case they will automatically fight the monster again afterwards and this will repeat indefinitely.

## Chance to win
The key statistic of a combat you've left to idle is your win percentage: it could be 0% or 100% or anything in between based on your gear, the monster level, or any other circumstances. As the player you want this to be as high as possible as the loot from the monster is only dropped in the case that you win.

## Monster mastery
Just as you gain mastery XP in activities, gain mxp per monster you fight. There will be thresholds of mastery points per monster and as you meet them it unlocks:
* Weakness of the monster
* Greater rewards for beating it
Perhaps we should consider some consistency on this point: one threshold for weakness, one for greater reward for beating it.

Monster mastery is gained when you defeat the monster. It is not gained when you lose to it; however you bank half of what you would have gained when you lose and the total banked mastery xp is gained after the next win.

## Regeneration
When the player loses a combat their character goes into a state of regeneration for a fixed amount of time. It happens automatically and when complete they automatically begin the same fight over again.

Items/spells can give bonuses related to regeneration:
- Boost regen speed
- Buff to next fight after a regen
- Gain mastery vs the thing that caused you to regen during regen

## First Conquest reward
The first time a monster is defeated you receive a First Conquest reward:
* Show a notification in the UI on the monster's tile. When clicked it says the monster was defeated and the player is granted a one time bonus. Could be extra of whatever they normally drop or a unique item.
* Checkmark of some kind on the monster to show you've beaten it.
The idea is that we can avoid what i felt in melvor was too much temptation to blow past all the different monsters that were available to train. Felt a little like i shouldn't bother to beat them and i would never remember if i even had.

# Player loadout
The primary factor in deciding the outcome of a fight is the player's loadout. All the following things determine the player's strength, roughly in the following order of importance:
* Spell the player has equipped.
* Gear worn by the player
* Potions imbibed
* Passive benefits from other skills, e.g. Familiars

## Tags and Mastery
Mastery in combat is not done on a per-monster basis but on a per-tag basis. Each monster would have one or more tags, e.g. Beast, Militia. When you fight monsters you get mastery xp in their tags and level up those tags. Tags have mastery thresholds just like skills do that expose weaknesses of the monsters that have that tag, or grant better rewards against that monster.

# Tag ideas
* Tag that rewards certain parts of the player loadout. e.g. weakness to certain elements
* Weakness that scales up depending on player's level in another skill. E.g. herbology confers bonus damage against plant enemies
* Mysterious cult played for laughs. They say ominous things and make threats but they seem to be empty. "You play your part in the sinful entreaty." Other factions don't take them seriously.
