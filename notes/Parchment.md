Every spell needs parchment as an input to create it.

# Early game
Obtain parchment from the store for one coin per page. Or get old books from Organizing Spellbooks that convert into 1000 parchment.

# Inscribition
Craft "Empowered Parchment" in the Inscribition class which can be used in place of plain parchment. Using empowered parchment to create spells results in an empowered version of the spell.
