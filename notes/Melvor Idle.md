I really like Melvor Idle, and I think a lot about why I like it more than the many other idle games I've played.
* **No microtransactions**. You can pay a one time fee for some features (the ability to sync across devices? Anything else?) but otherwise it's totally free. This matters to me not because of wanting to save money but rather because I value playing a game the way I know it was intended to be played. I don't want to play a different game than someone else because I paid and they didn't or vice versa or something in between. An even playing field is just more fun *even in strictly single-player games*. 
* More idle than a lot of other idle games. I view Melvor Idle as closer to [[Tending a Garden]] than playing a game. 
* Does an admirable job walking a fine line between **having paths for optimization** and **letting you play however you want**.
	* Some games are very open ended but very punishing if you do things wrong where you'll waste a ton of time or resources. Most MMOs are like this but even most single player idle games too. This makes you feel like you don't even want to play because it requires a mini-PHD in the game's mechanics and the meta otherwise you're totally wasting your time.
	* In contrast some games let you "play however *you* want". Translation: there's no reason to play it any particular way at all. I want to be rewarded for putting some thought into what order I do things and for looking up some strategies online. 
	* In my view Melvor solves this by making most bonuses in the range of 5% or so (although there are outliers that are higher than that for variety, typically saved for milestone rewards). This is as much about perception as it is about reality: stacking many of these 5% bonuses in an optimal way probably does add up to an overall doubling or tripling of efficiency. But in the moment where I'm wondering whether the next activity I plan to do should really come next or if it would be better to do something else I find it easy because of how low the numbers are to just say fuck it and do what I want to do. 
* There's variety along different dimensions with each profession. 
	* **Woodcutting**: the most simple profession; it's there to be the yardstick for other professions. Yet even this introductory profession has the somewhat unique "cutting two trees" mechanic later on, where the exp and time from two trees are combined somehow.
	* **Fishing**: you receive a mix of fish, junk, and special items, and the composition changes as you progress in mastery of the fish and the overall profession. It even goes backwards a bit as late game you might want to put on gear decreasing the special item droprate.
		* Also fish are somewhat arbitrarily divided into different fishing areas with differen drop rates of special items and junk. And some items unlock new areas.
	* **Firemaking**: the most passive and boring profession. It is odd in that it's mostly a resource sink for wood and outputs a small amount of coal. Yet it's much sought after for its skillcape which benefits every other skill and thus you should level it first. And that theme is continued in how mastering burning each type of log gets you global mastery EXP.
		* I would like to see that theme of empowering other professions highlighted more somehow. If a player never learns of the skillcape by reading guides online they'd probably question the game design skills of whoever put the profession in.
		* I'd also like to see the mechanic where a certain tier of firemaking unlocks the higher cooking fire carried further. And be less confusing. 
		* Flavor-wise it doesn't make a ton of sense. Alternative ideas: meditation, hiking nature, exercise.
	* **Cooking**: this profession is the bridge from several other professions to combat. Items from Fishing, farming, thievery are inputs, food that enables combat are outputs. Its distinction from other crafting professions is the fact that it has upgradeable "tools" (something only gathering professions normally have) and that there's three types of tools (pots, oven, cookfire).
	* **Mining**: similar to woocutting, it is a very basic gathering profession. In fact I think it might be too similar; early on in playing Melvor I leveled both of these and was starting to get the impression that the game wasn't all that deep because mining felt like a reskin of woocutting.
		* Mining's unique mechanic is that different metals' nodes run out of hitpoints and must respawn before you can mine them again. I think the idea is that you might switch to mining another node while the first respawns. In practice the respawn time is short enough at all tiers except maybe the highest that it can be ignored. I personally didn't notice the mechanic existed until I hit runite ore and thought that something was buggy.
			* As noted, this is a bad "unique" mechanic becuase it doesn't affect decision making. In practice the player just assumes that bonuses to node health or respawn time just affect the mining speed but with more steps.
			* It also doesn't make a lot of sense as far as theme. Rocks don't respawn, in fact they seem like one of the most improbable types of resources to have a respawn mechanic for. They should exist in vast quantities and the uniqueness should instead be something about building mining tunnels.
	* **Smithing**:
	* **Thieving**:
	* **Farming**:
	* **Fletching**:
	* **Crafting**:
	* **Runecrafting**:
	* **Herblore**:
	* **Agility**:
		* The fact that there are different tiers of obstacle is not unique but what is unique is that decisions on early tiers affect the efficiency of your later tier since you're forced to run through early obstacles to get to later ones. So you have to decide whether you want early obstacles with better benefits or shorter run times.
		* What works about agility: flexibility to choose the buffs you want
		* What doesn't work: being forced to buy back your tier when you change your mind feels shitty. We should find a different way to incentivize picking the right alternative that's less punishing and doesn't make you feel like quitting the game.
			* Fixed cost that ramps every new one you unlock? E.g. first obstacle you buy in a tier costs 1x its cost, second, is 2x, third is 4x. But if you come back to the first it is...free?
				* This is good because it makes you think which unlock you want but know you won't be punished too hard if you're on A and want to go to B but know you'll come back to A
				* Also good because you're only losing "short term" efficiency by being indecisive; you know you'll have to pay the 4x cost eventually to get them all leveled.
	* **Summoning**:
		* Interacts indirectly with every other profession in a unique way; you passively find marks while doing other activities that will be helpful here. I definitely think we should lean on that more and it doesn't reach its full potential in Melvor. The system where you have to craft one summoning tablet before more marks will appear is more of a pain than is worth it. Its presumable goal of forcing you to discover the system sooner rather than later can be served by making it so e.g. a passive bonus becomes available for unlock when you go to the page. 
		* The mark production feels different than other crafting because you are producing 25x of something rather than the typical 1x of something
		* It also has direct ties to every other profession since it usually requires mats such as daggers which you craft in other places

	* **Alt. Magic**:
