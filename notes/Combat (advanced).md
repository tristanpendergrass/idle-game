Advanced combat is an idea for a version of combat where it is a puzzle-like minigame of choosing the right spells in the right order to optimize your fight.

Enemies have loadouts of spells and you have a loadout as well, and each turn of combat your spell and the enemy's go off simultaneously and damage is dealt out or blocked, buffs and debuffs are applied, etc.

Players have a roster of monsters to fight. When they choose to fight one the battle will proceed automatically. If the player wins they will get loot and experience, if they lose they will have to spend some time regenerating. In either case they will automatically fight the monster again afterwards and this will repeat indefinitely.

# Combat Spells
## Types of spells
Spells in combat should generally fall into one of several categories:
* Damage spells. Ideal for pushing difficult content and required in most every loadout.
* Healing/defense spells. Also mainly necessary for difficult content.
* Support spells, buffs the others.
* Meta spells, interact with the larger combat cyle in some way by buffing drops, buffing regen time, etc.

## Tags and Mastery
Mastery in combat is not done on a per-monster basis but on a per-tag basis. Each monster would have one or more tags, e.g. Beast, Militia. When you fight monsters you get mastery xp in their tags and level up those tags. Tags have mastery thresholds just like skills do that expose weaknesses of the monsters that have that tag, or grant better rewards against that monster.

# Spell ideas
* Deal small damage. Deal more for each consecutive instance of this spell that is cast
* Support spell that increases loot from this combat. Or increases mxp gained if lose the combat.
* Support spell that gives a chance to recover other spells used in this combat
* Mirror the move of the opponent.
* Buff punches. This playstyle of using a couple punches (or one big punch) should be particularly effect against some monsters. 

# Tag ideas
Monsters have tags that alter combat with them in some way.
* Feral - each consecutive move that does damage does even more damage (incentivize to let them hit you once or twice then interrupt with a strong block)
* Bounty - this monster i wanted by authorities. Not sure the effect ..
* Wily - this monster randomly cycles through a few different move loadouts

# Random concepts
* Mana system like in Yi Xian
* Take damage = get better stuff support spell. Useful for farming lower tier mobs later like in Returnal
* Helpers and lackeys.
    * One part meat shield, one part
