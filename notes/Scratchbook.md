* For combat what if % chance to win came down to two numbers: strength and technique. 

# V3 
What is the purpose of shipping what I've got now instead of forging ahead with fundamental features?
* Motivation provided by shipping milestones keeps me working more 
    * Feel this is less important lately, as I have plenty of motivation regardless
* Shipping forces me to put in somewhat-real values for game config instead of dummy ones, which exposes weaknesses in the engine/process. For instance in V3 I realized that it was going to be too many edits to add new entities so I started to use codegen.
    * This was just shown as fairly important with the codegen things.
* I need to learn what is a fun game design by playing a vertical slice myself and getting feedback from others in order to prioritize and choose what fundamental features to develop in the future.
    * Less important to the degree I'm taking inspiration from an existing game, more important to the degree I'm innovating

What do I have right now?
* Chores, a skill that simply completes and gives you stuff
* Hexes, a skill that consumes stuff to study spells that can be used in combat
* Weathermancing, a skill that consumes stuff to study spells that buff other activities
* Shop where you can buy upgrades and resources
* Locations where you can explore and gather resources
* Quests which you can complete to get resources in exchange for other ones
* Monsters which you can fight to get rewarded

What are the key elements of fun here?
* Do chores -> get money -> buy upgrades to make chores faster
    * Also watch your mastery go up in chores and get those milestones to make doing them more efficient
    * Also anticipate what new chores will give in terms of XP and coin and resources
* Notice that weathermancing level 1 exists, and gives a bonus to all chores. This should entice the player to study it
* With the goal of beating the hardest monsters a location has to offer
