The main activity you're doing is either gathering things, or turning things into other things. The end of the pipeline is created final products that will be used up. That could be either buffs that feed back into yourself or expended on leveling up to the next tier of content in some way. At each level, various buffs are applicable.
- Gathering things
    - Gather faster
    - Gather more
    - Gather other stuff too
    - Gather more reliably, for things that are random. This is really just faster though.
- Turning things into other things
    - Craft faster
    - Craft more
    - Consume less
    - Craft other stuff too
    - Craft higher quality items
    - Have more insights
    - Craft more reliably
- Using things up
    - Use faster
    - Use less stuff
    - Get more in return

Challenges
- Coming up with enough different buffs for spells, items, masteries, quest rewards, etc.
- Threading the difference between too much monotony and too much variety. I hate games that seem unimaginative by having the rewards go like: +xp in woodlands, +mxp in woodlands, +speed in woodlands, then repeat for the other three biome types.
- But at the same time the naive solution of just make each activity do something different has some pitfalls: thinking about each new effect gets fatiguing to the user, each new effect gets rounded off to "useless" in the user's mind since they can't *all* be useful. And seeing some new effect as a Major reward loses its luster when everything is new, meaning you've lost some potential ability to pace your rewards and even give out big ones. Boring rewards are necessary in a game.
### Emergent effects
The solution to this is emergent effects. Example: in Earthborne Rangers there's a Being with Ambush, meaning it fatigues you when it enters Within Reach.
	- First of all, Ambush utilizes emergent effects because it fatigues you equal to the being's Presence, a stat that is used for other things. So it doesn't need to say "Ambush 2" or anything in most cases.
	- Second of all, the being has challenge effects that say it escapes to Along the Way sometimes. This has the dual effect of inconveniencing other rangers because now it will be active on each of their turns, as well as allowing it to potentially move Within Reach again, triggering Ambush again.

### Gear
My idea for gear is that it is the mechanism by which we open up more spell slots. That is, a fire staff would allow you to assign another spell slot of type Fire when executing any activity. There could be other effects, like the spell in that slot is more powerful, but the slot is the main thing.

Robes could operate the same, or be slightly different. How so? Brainstorm: a robe opens up a flex slot that can be used by anything, but only for certain activities (collect all robes). Don't love this idea. 

Robes could increase the power level of spells that can be assigned by 1 or 2 points.7d

Perhaps a gear that in combat lets you equip a bonus spell to be cast first and once before the regular series starts.

### Wandering
How Wandering works:
Each area has a Wander activity. Effects:
- Periodically gather a discovered resource from area
- Periodically discover something new in the area
Discoveries:
- Resources. These are activities that can only be activated as a side effect of Wander. They can have spells assigned and have an option to prioritize gathering them.
- Monsters. TBD.
- Quests. These are single shot or repeat quests that consume a lot of resources to give you a lot.
- Npcs. These have unique interactions, including quests, dialogue, buffs, and so on.

Sample starter zone: School Grounds.
- Two resources
- Six quests.
- Two npcs. One gives daily tips and a 10% xp buff lasting 24 hrs. The other trades for equipment that buffs various woodland gathering things. They want items obtained as rare drops from jobs.

New entities:
- Resources
- Quests
- Npcs
