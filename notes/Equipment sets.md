Melvor Idle's equipment set system leaves a lot to be desired. You have only one set for a long time and eventually unlock a second (it's expensive) and I believe a third? A quick-equip menu exists but has some limitations.

# Problems with Melvor's item sets
* Have to remember which items you should be using for a given task. The quick-equip menu helps with this a bit but not too much-- there's still items you'll want equipped or un-equipped that don't show up in that menu like things that boost global gold or resource preservation.
* Actually locating all the items in your inventory and pressing the buttons to equip them (not a single press-- more like two or three per item!). Hopefully you had the wisdom to group them all in one tab of your inventory or this will be complete hell.

## Advantages
* Having to manually equip items every time contributes to the sense of [[Immersion]]. 
* The ritual of equipping new items is arguably a vital part of the pacing of the game. If you could switch tasks just by hitting a single button players might grow accustomed to not thinking as hard about which task they should do next. This encourages [[Deliberation]]. 
* Equipping these items manually is a constant reminder of how far you've come and the bonuses you have. If we just grant the player a global "+10% faster chopping wood" buff, it won't be long before they take it for granted and wood chopping feels slow again. I see this a ton with other idle games that have order-of-magnitude progression built in where for a brief window you feel faster before fast becomes the new normal. If we instead grant players an item with "+10% faster chopping wood" they'll feel powerful every time they equip it from now on.

# Proposals
## Equipped items stay in inventory
Items you equip should get marked as such in your inventory but otherwise remain there taking up space.
* In Melvor granting the player an item set is like granting them more inventory space, and inventory space is supposed to be limited. I believe this may be why Melvor gives you only one or two item sets.
* Allows items to be equipped to multiple item sets simultaneously
* Never fail to find your items in inventory because they're equipped 

## Quick equip menu

This is a useful feature in Melvor, although I didn't discover it until well into the midgame. It allows the player to equip whatever items they want with a quick and small menu that intelligently displays all the items it thinks you might want to equip for whatever profession you're currently viewing.

One downside of this is that equipping the items is still arguably rote work to do every time.
Another downside is that in order to not be unwieldy the Melvor implementation of this idea only displays items that definitely affect the given profession. But that leaves certain items like ones that give global boosts to gold gain and resource preservation not shown by default. I did read something that I haven't tried about how you can customize what shows up in the quick equip menu and will have to try that. But this feels like a band-aid on top of a band-aid on top of a band-aid.

## One equipment set per profession
The first alternative approach to equipment sets that pops into my mind is to have one set per profession. This set could be automatically equipped when changing to the given profession.

Players could receive equipment that will be useful to them in a profession they won't work on for awhile and equip it right away and be assured they won't forget about it.

There would be no rote chore of having to press a bunch of buttons when changing tasks.

The downside to this is that it lacks a lot of the non-obvious advantages of Melvor's system, catalogued above, such as Immersion and Deliberation.
