# Gathering Shop Upgrades
Seven progressive upgrades to unlock and purchase. Each tier must be purchased before the next is shown, and each tier increases gathering speed in Gathering 1. They cost sharply more money as you go up the tiers.
# Gathering Skill 1
## Nodes
There are nine very similar nodes that unlock via leveling up. Each is a logical progression of the previous. Higher tier take longer time, reward more xp, an item that sells for more.

## Mastery Pool Checkpoints
* 10%: +5% mxp in skill
* 25%: +5% doubling chance in Gathering 1
* 50%: +50% sell value of items from Gathering 1
* 95%: Gain double of rare item

## Mastery Unlocks
* Every 10 levels: +5% doubling chance in this node
* 99: Increase speed by flat 0.2 seconds

# Gathering Skill 2
## Nodes
Twenty (!) nodes to gather from, divided into areas of two - four nodes each. Nodes unlock somewhat in order of their area but sometimes you will still have locked nodes in an area when a node from a further one unlocks.
Areas are distinct in their base rate of getting a resource, special item, or junk.
Nodes take different range of times to gather.

## Mastery Pool Checkpoints 
* 10%: +5% mxp in skill
* 25%: Receive no more junk
* 50%: +5% doubling chance in Gathering 2
* 95%: +25% doubling chance for special item

## Mastery Unlocks
* Every 1 level: +0.4% doubling chance in this node
* 50: +3% special item chance in this node 
* 65: Receive no more junk when gathering this node
* 99: +1 base quantity of main resource

# Gathering Skill 3
## Nodes
Eleven nodes to gather. Each takes the same amount of time, but there's a mechanic where the node can get depleted and has to respawn which increases with higher tier nodes making them take longer in practice. 

## Mastery Pool Unlocks
* 10%: +5% mxp in skill
* 25%: Reduce respawn rate by 10%
* 50%: Increase speed by 0.2s
* 95%: Every node has increased HP

## Mastery Unlocks
* Every 1 level: +1 HP of this node
* Every 10 levels: +1% doubling chance in this node
* 99: +6% doubling chance in this node
