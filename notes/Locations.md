Adventuring is a different mode than Skilling which offers rewards not found anywhere else. 
Each tab in the Adventuring mode is a different Location containing various activities.

# Locations
When you engage in adventuring you are always doing it in a specific location.
* School Grounds
* Small village
* Large city
* Evil fortress, outer
* Evil fortress, inner

# Locations

# Completion
A big simple number that goes from 0 to 100% as you do stuff in a location. All the stuff to do contributes and when it's all done you have 100% completion.
* Discovering each resource
* Discovering each monster
* Completing mastery of each monster (does this make sense? What if we are doing the tag mastery system?)
* Completing each quest
* Discovering each NPC
### Calculating completion
The contribution of each thing to the percent is pretty arbitrary. For instance, discovering of a resource might be 2.5%, while reaching 100 mastery against a monster might be 5%.

# Unlocking locations
For now we'll keep unlocking simple: locations unlock in a linear order, you must have 50% completion on the previous location.

## Unlocking stuff in the location
Exploring a location should be a different experience for the player depending on their previous progression
* If they have not explored the location at all before, they should discover a resource within seconds of their first explore action
* They should continue to gather resources while exploring in this early stage, gradually discovering an additional 2 or 3 types to be added to the pool of resources that might be gathered
* Eventually (perhaps in a range of 30min - 4 hours) they should discover their first Monster.
* 

# Quests
Similar to Melvor's Township quests. Discover these by exploring the location.

Types of quests:
* Donate X of resource Y
* Have a certain spell learned 
* Defeat X monster Y times
### Quest rewards
I like that in Melvor's township quests you were often asked to turn in a certain resource and were rewarded with more of the same resource in kind than you turned in.

For example, a question might require you to turn in 100 chicken feathers; the reward would be 150 chicken feathers. Does this make much sense? Not really. It doesn't fit in with how other RPG's typically do their quests either, probably on the basis that it's more interesting to turn in X to get Y, and makes more flavorful sense too.

But for an idle game like this, an "in-kind" reward system has the advantage of making the Quest system feel unique. Other skills transform resources into different resources, so goalposts get organically created in that way (accumulate 1000 parchment-> turn it into 1000 fire parchment). Questing, on the other hand, creates goalposts of a different sort. They're more artificial, since the game sets the quantity needed, but they are also uniquely rewarding since you are transparently "getting something for nothing" by getting more out than you put in. And unlike with farming you don't have to wait either, it happens almost automatically just as a reward for saving.
# Monsters
Once discovered from Exploring a Location, they can be fought in that location.
 
# Resources
* What resources can be found in a location. The number of possiblities and some clue to their identity should be visible from the outset, but they must be "discovered" during exploration. 
* Discover resources as you explore
* Resources already discovered will still be collected at random intervals. Player may select which one is their focus. *Or should that require a spell?*

# Denizens
NPCs you meet who hold the key to powerful upgrades to various skills. 
## Upgrade tree
Each denizen has a bespoke upgrade system. In general, you need to provide something to unlock progressively higher tiers of rewards.
#### Unlock ideas:
* Simply pay resources -- they need help building their house or something
* Collect charms which drop only as a resource when exploring the location they're at
* Collect charms which drop only when defeating monsters in the location. Or from a specific monster.
* Gives you special seeds that need to be planted and then the fruits given to them.
* Gives you equipment that you have to equip then defeat certain monsters

#### Reward ideas:
I think a nice balance would be four rewards per denizen, each a permanent buff:
* three that enhance your Adventuring specifically in that location (faster exploration, more resources gathered, better combat, etc.)
* one that enhances some skill or is globally applicable
