# Before email is registered
When user first visits the app we want to get them into a game without delay, and afford them the opportunity to create an authenticated session later if they want.

When they first visit as a logged out user, we should show a screen depicting the player's visiting at the gates of the magic school. The following dialog options are presented:
* **"You know me"** (log in)
* **"Put my name down"** (Register new Idle Magic account)
* ***walk past without saying anything*** (Start game, Register account later)

# Multiple save games
We want to allow multiple saves per registered user; there will be a screen where you can review all of them and "enter" them. You won't see this screen on login but rather be placed in the most recently played game, but you can reach it from the options? .0
