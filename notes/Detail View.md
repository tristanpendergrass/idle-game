The detail view is a view that shows more info about a given activity, item, or anything. On full width browser it will be a sidebar on the righthand side of the screen. On mobile/tablet it will be a collapsible full-wdith view, which when collapsed may show a status bar at the bottom.

# Data model
How to encapsulate the state of what's shown? We want a lot of flexibility in what's shown:
* An activity from a skill
* Detail on an item or resource
* Maybe even settings?
