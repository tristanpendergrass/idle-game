# Task: Design Sample Quests with Resource Requirements

**Problem:** The quest system needs concrete quest content to demonstrate functionality and provide players with meaningful objectives that consume existing game resources and reward coins.

**Dependencies:** Task 1 (Define Quest System Data Model and Types)

**Plan:**
1. Review existing resource types in the codebase to understand what resources are available
2. Design 3-4 sample quests with generic names that fit the medical school setting
3. Create quest configurations with varied resource requirements (single resource, multiple resources, different amounts)
4. Set appropriate coin reward amounts for each quest based on resource costs
5. Write quest descriptions that explain the objective and resource requirements clearly
6. Ensure quest names and descriptions fit the existing game theme and tone
7. Add quest data to appropriate configuration files or constants

**Success Criteria:**
- 3-4 sample quests created with unique names fitting the medical school setting
- Quests have varied resource requirements using existing game resources
- Quest coin rewards are balanced relative to resource costs
- Quest descriptions are clear and thematically appropriate
- Quest configurations are properly structured according to the Quest type definition
- Quest data is accessible for use in the game system
- Code compiles without errors
